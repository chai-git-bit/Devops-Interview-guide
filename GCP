### 4. Explain Regions and Zones.

**Answer:**

* **Region** → Geographic location (e.g., australia-southeast1)
* **Zone** → Isolated location within a region (e.g., australia-southeast1-a)
  Using multiple zones improves availability.

## 🏗️ Scenario 1: High Availability Web Application

### **Question:**

How would you design a highly available web application in GCP?

**Answer (Interview-Ready):**

> I would deploy the application using **Managed Instance Groups across multiple zones** within a region. Traffic would be routed through an **HTTP(S) Load Balancer**.
> For the database, I’d use **Cloud SQL with a read replica** or **Cloud Spanner** if global scale is needed.
