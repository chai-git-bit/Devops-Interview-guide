## 1️⃣ GCP Production Incident – Pod CrashLoopBackOff

**Q:**
A production application on **GKE** suddenly goes into `CrashLoopBackOff`. What do you do?

**A (Real-time approach):**

> First, I check the pod logs using `kubectl logs` to identify application-level errors.
> Then I describe the pod to look for configuration or resource issues like failed liveness probes or OOMKills.
> I verify recent changes through GitOps history or CI/CD deployments.
> If needed, I roll back to the last stable version, communicate status to stakeholders, and later perform RCA to prevent recurrence.

## 2️⃣ Terraform Drift in GCP

**Q:**
What is Terraform drift and how do you handle it?

**A:**

> Terraform drift occurs when resources in GCP are changed manually outside Terraform.
> I detect drift using `terraform plan`.
> In regulated environments, I restrict console access, enforce IaC-only changes via GitOps, and regularly reconcile state.
> If drift is legitimate, I update the Terraform code to match reality and reapply.

## 3️⃣ Secure Landing Zone Design

**Q:**
How do you design a secure GCP landing zone?

**A:**

> I use a multi-project structure with separate projects for networking, security, and workloads.
> I enforce org policies, IAM least privilege, VPC Service Controls, private Google access, and centralized logging.
> Networking is done using shared VPCs with controlled subnet access.
> Everything is provisioned via Terraform to ensure consistency and auditability.

## 4️⃣ Cloud Run vs GKE – Real Choice

**Q:**
When would you choose Cloud Run over GKE?

**A:**

> I choose Cloud Run for stateless, event-driven workloads where I want minimal ops, fast scaling, and per-request billing.
> GKE is better when I need advanced networking, sidecars, stateful services, or fine-grained control.
> In practice, I often use both — Cloud Run for APIs and GKE for core platforms.

## 5️⃣ CI/CD Pipeline Failure at Deployment Stage

**Q:**
A pipeline fails while deploying to GCP. What do you check?

**A:**

> I check the pipeline logs to identify whether it’s authentication, permissions, or resource quota related.
> Then I validate service account roles, workload identity bindings, and Terraform state consistency.
> If it’s environment-specific, I compare configs across dev, test, and prod to find drift.

## 6️⃣ IAM Issue – Access Denied in Production

**Q:**
A service suddenly gets `403 Access Denied`. What’s your approach?

**A:**

> I identify which service account is failing and verify recent IAM changes.
> I check project-level and resource-level permissions.
> I avoid granting owner roles and instead assign minimum required predefined or custom roles.
> After fixing access, I add monitoring and alerts for IAM changes.

## 7️⃣ GCP Networking – Private & Secure Design

**Q:**
How do you design secure networking in GCP?

**A:**

> I use private subnets with no public IPs, Cloud NAT for outbound traffic, and internal load balancers.
> Firewall rules are restrictive by default.
> DNS is managed centrally, and sensitive services are protected using VPC Service Controls and private endpoints.

---

## 8️⃣ Migration Scenario – On-Prem to GCP

**Q:**
How would you migrate an on-prem application to GCP?

**A:**

> I first assess dependencies, data size, latency, and security requirements.
> I usually migrate infrastructure using Terraform, containerize applications where possible, and deploy to GKE or Cloud Run.
> Data is migrated using Database Migration Service or Storage Transfer Service.
> I validate performance before cutover and ensure rollback plans exist.

---

## 9️⃣ Observability & Monitoring

**Q:**
How do you monitor GCP workloads?

**A:**

> I use Cloud Monitoring and Logging with custom metrics, alerts, and dashboards.
> For GKE, I monitor pod health, latency, error rates, and resource usage.
> Alerts are actionable and mapped to SLAs/SLOs to reduce alert fatigue.

## 🔟 Government / Enterprise Compliance Question

**Q:**
How do you ensure compliance in GCP?

**A:**

> I enforce policies using Organization Policies, IAM restrictions, audit logging, and encryption by default.
> Infrastructure is fully managed via Terraform and peer-reviewed.
> Access is logged, changes are traceable, and environments are isolated to meet government security standards.

## Bonus: Consultant-Style Closing Answer

If they ask **“Why you?”**, say:

> I combine strong hands-on GCP engineering skills with a consulting mindset.
> I focus on secure, scalable solutions, clear communication with stakeholders, and delivering long-term value rather than quick fixes.
